# HME-Labels
App to print labels for inventory

## Goal
Create an app that takes a CSV file as input and displays labels to be printed

## Plan of action
1. Create UI to input CSV file
2. Display CSV data on labels to be printed
3. Test that the correct amount of labels are printed per page
4. Test what will happen if text to longer then the label box
    -Will it wrap to the next line? will it go onto the next box?

## Purpose
Labels have were written with pen and have started to fade. Using this app to print labels will make them last longer and be easier to update information and add new labels for new products

## Features
* Parse CSV files
* Display barcode
* Print labels to correct size
